# Final-Task

You need to create a database to store the data from the checkout form. The checkout form will be part of a web page that allows a user to purchase a product. 
The form will collect the user's name, email, and mobile number. When the user clicks the "Order and Pay" button, they will be redirected to a payment gateway. 
You will be provided with a Git repository containing the HTML code for the web page.

Your first task is to modify the checkout form so that it collects the necessary information without the "Pay Now" button. 
Instead, when the user fills out the form and clicks the "Order and Pay" button, a new session ID will be created and the user will be redirected to the payment gateway.

Your second task is to create a database to store the data from the modified checkout form. 
This can be done using a Google Sheet or any other database solution of your choice. 
The database should store the user's name, email, and mobile number.
